## Wallet Types

Lightspark supports multiple wallet architectures to fit different use cases:

### Custodial Wallets

Lightspark manages the private keys on behalf of your users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pros">
    - Simplified user experience
    - No seed phrase management
    - Instant onboarding
    - Recovery handled by Lightspark
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cons">
    - Users trust Lightspark with funds
    - Regulatory considerations
    - Single point of control
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Non-Custodial Wallets

Users maintain control of their private keys.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pros">
    - Full user sovereignty
    - Reduced regulatory burden
    - True self-custody
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cons">
    - User responsible for backups
    - More complex UX
    - Potential for lost funds
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Wallet

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
const wallet = await client.createWallet({
  accountId: "your-account-id",
  walletType: "CUSTODIAL",
});

console.log("Wallet ID:", wallet.id);
```

```python Python
wallet = client.create_wallet(
    account_id="your-account-id",
    wallet_type="CUSTODIAL",
)

print(f"Wallet ID: {wallet.id}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Wallet Operations

### Check Balance

```typescript
const balance = await client.getWalletBalance(walletId);

console.log({
  available: balance.availableMsats,
  pending: balance.pendingMsats,
  total: balance.totalMsats,
});
```

### List Transactions

```typescript
const transactions = await client.getWalletTransactions({
  walletId,
  limit: 20,
  status: ["COMPLETED", "PENDING"],
});
```
