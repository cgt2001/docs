## What is the Lightning Network?

The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables fast, low-cost transactions by creating a network of payment channels between participants.

## How It Works

### Payment Channels

Payment channels are the fundamental building blocks of Lightning:

1. **Opening a Channel**: Two parties lock Bitcoin in a multi-signature address on-chain
2. **Transacting**: They can now exchange value instantly by updating the channel state
3. **Closing a Channel**: Either party can close the channel and settle the final balance on-chain

### Routing

Payments can be routed through multiple channels to reach any participant in the network, even without a direct channel:

```
Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave
```

Each hop is trustless and atomic — either the entire payment succeeds or it fails completely.

## Benefits

| Feature | On-Chain Bitcoin | Lightning Network |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Speed | ~10 minutes | Milliseconds |
| Fees | Variable, can be high | Fraction of a cent |
| Throughput | ~7 TPS | Millions of TPS |
| Privacy | Pseudonymous | Enhanced |
